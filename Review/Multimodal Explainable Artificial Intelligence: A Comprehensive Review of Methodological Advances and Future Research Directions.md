MXAI's key challenges : 
1. Identification of the modality with the highest impact on overall model's prediction.
2. Discovery of the most salient features in each modality. (Which features of each modality help model's prediction)
3. Detection of causal relations in model's input-output data streams for generating explanations more easily conceivable by humans. 
4. Analysis of algorithms of increased complexity that are usaually needed for handling multimodal data. (ex. Fusion Operation / Model for fused features)

''' I wonder how MAXI can be applied to Radar+Camera Fusion Research. Which Radar features is the most salient to perform 3D Detection or Segmentation Tasks. 
And I need MAXI usable techniques and evaluating methods'''

# 3-A : Criteria and Resulting Categories of MXAI Methods
* Aim of explanation : (1) focusing on model's internal logic and behavior / (2) aiming at interpreting the model's predictions in a more human-friendly way
* Exclusiveness of explanation : (1) explaining overall model's behavior / (2) focus on interpreting the produced decision concerning specific data points (GradCAM)
''' I think we can make both explanation from single XAI techniques'''
* Model dependency : (1) Model Agnostic / (2) Model Specific
* Data Dependency : adopted so as to operate only for specific data types
* Unimodal task and unimodal explanation (UU) 
* Unimodal task and multimodal explanation (UM)
* Multimodal task and unimodal explanation (MU)
* Multimodal task and multimodal explanation (MM)
* Intrinsic : Methods producing explanations by analyzing model's internal structure and parameters of the model that has been developed for the primary task
* Post-hoc : Explanations solely based on the model's output without seeing model's internal construction
* Seperate module : Incorporates methods that develop a distinct model in order to generate the required explanations. 
Joint Training (explanation module is trained along with the model used for the primary task) (eg. Generating Visual Explanations ECCV 2016)
Incremental training (explanation module is constructed after the model for the primary task has been developed) 
'''How can we set separate module while training sensor fusion model?'''
