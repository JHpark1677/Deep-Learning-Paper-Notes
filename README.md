# About
My name is Park Jae Hyun. I major in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/). I'm a graduate student at Radio Technology Lab of [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/index.html). 
Now, I'm working on 3D Object Detection Tasks exploiting the radar-camera sensor fusion techniques. And I'm highly motivated to create technologically fancy outputs.

This repository is the collection of various research papers that I'm dealing with, which is inspired by [Denny britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes), [Daniel Takeshi](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes) and [Patric Langechuan Liu](https://patrick-llgc.github.io/Learning-Deep-Learning/). The number of small stars indicate the importance and the circle indicates a degree of achievement of the papaer understanding.
For example, the understanding score is based on the checklists
