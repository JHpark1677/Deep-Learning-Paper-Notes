# About
My name is Park Jae Hyun. I major in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at POSTECH (2017-2022). <br> I'm a graduate student at Radio Technology Lab of Seoul National University. 
Now, I'm working on 3D Object Detection Tasks exploiting the radar-camera sensor fusion techniques, and highly motivated to create technologically fancy things.

This repository is the collection of various research papers that I've read which is inspired by [Denny britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes), [Daniel Takeshi](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes) and [Patric Langechuan Liu](https://patrick-llgc.github.io/Learning-Deep-Learning/).
